What do competitive tennis players do to improve their game? Currently options include rigorous practice and using a personal (human) coach. But what if players could take it a step further with a tool that tracks statistics, analyzes performance, and identifies areas of improvement? Our project explores the creation of such a tool.

Check back here to watch our project grow. Starting October 5th, we will begin posting continuous project updates here. You will be able to see what we are working on and provide feedback/comments that you may find helpful in putting us in the right direction.
