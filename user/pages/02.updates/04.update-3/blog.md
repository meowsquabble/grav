“**Tennis dad/mom**: *n.* a man/woman whose child plays, or whose children play, tennis; esp. a father/mother who actively and enthusiastically supports his/her child or children's participation in the sport.”
– *Oxford English Dictionary*

===

Much like the well-known term “soccer mom/dad”, the “tennis mom/dad” has become popular, making its way into the Oxford English Dictionary in June this year. Our resident tennis expert Daniele has seen a great deal of them through his years on the court. He’s observed that sometimes an actively supportive parent could make all the difference when taking a young player’s performance to the next level. For elite junior players, this could mean playing at the national or international level.

"Why their parents?" you might ask. "Why not their children, the ones actually playing?” Good question. From our interviews, we found out that most elite tennis players reach their peak development potential in their youth. This critical window between the ages of 12 to 18 essentially determines whether a player has what it takes to “go pro”. As such, parents and coaches of talented young players spend a great deal of effort developing sophisticated training regimens for them. Some parents even go as far as acting as their child’s personal coach. And so we sought to find out: What are their training secrets?
                                                                                                        
This week we caught up with the parents of several top-tier junior players. The four parents share decades of experience supporting their children, most of whom have played tennis internationally and have stood within the top ten junior players in British Columbia. Here’s what we learned from the interview:  
* **The teenage years are indeed the “critical period” during which a junior player’s scouting potential for professional opportunities is maximized.** All four parents agreed that tennis players hit their peak development as juniors. Some recalled the dedication they and their children devoted to tennis, sometimes spending more than 20 hours per week on the court.  
* **Statistic-tracking mobile applications and hardware devices are in demand, but currently available options aren’t quite meeting their needs.** One particularly tech-savvy parent created his own tablet-based application to track data he was interested in. We also heard complaints that currently available stats apps had either too many or too few options, or were difficult to learn. There was also some interest in hardware devices such as racket-mountable sensors, though some thought they were too expensive or “gimmicky” to include in their tennis budget.  
* **Video recordings of matches are useful, but not always the most convenient to create.** Most parents agreed on the usefulness of video, however few recorded their children regularly as this usually requires expensive equipment. Tennis video apps exist, such as Coach’s Eye, but they are expensive ($160 per year with additional in-app purchases).
* **“Tennis journals”, such as those provided by Tennis Canada, are rarely used.** The value of note-taking was agreed upon, but the general consensus was that keeping track of an external journal was tedious and usually reserved for the most serious of players.  
* **Communication between parents and coaches can be improved.** Parents were concerned about their children’s progress with hired coaches. They told us they would have liked to see coaches share information such as stats, notes, and media (video) with them.

We seem to have an interesting opportunity here. There appears to be some demand for an all-in-one solution – one that integrates the features described above (statistics, video, journals, and communications) in one place. At the same time, current products in the market that claim to offer one or some of these features seem to be falling short somehow. Our next steps are to take a closer look at some of these precedents and determine how we will differentiate.
