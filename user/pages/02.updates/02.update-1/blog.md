“What is tennis? How does it work? What is the tennis community?” These are the questions we are looking to understand. 

===

In conducting generative research, Meow Squad set out to the Coquitlam Tennis Club (CTC) to gather information about the community and their most commonly neglected needs. Ultimately, this information will inform a design solution that solves one or more of the unmet needs of competitive tennis players.

This week, we started where the action happens. 

We conducted interviews at the CTC’s annual Johan Memorial Tournament. We interviewed four adult players. All fell between 4.0 and 4.5 in skill level based on the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP), meaning they play with “good to very good consistency, with good depth and control”. Our interviews focused on players’ experiences with professional coaching and technological tools that are meant to help improve their game. The questions included: “Do you currently have a coach?”, “How do you improve your tennis skills? What resources do you utilize?”, and “After a match, what do you do to reflect and analyze your performance?”
 
We got a mixed bag of responses, as the interviewees turned out to be quite casual in their approaches to tennis. None of our subjects had a coach at the time, nor used technologies to track or otherwise improve their performance. Some were curious about novel technologies such as swing trackers, but did not have experience with any.
 
Although our interviewees were eager to share their stories with us, the information we gathered didn’t quite answer our research premise. None of our subjects had a coach at the time, nor used technologies to track or otherwise improve their performance. Even though this group may end up being a part of our broader audience, we did not glean much useful information. 

More questions came to mind. Were the interviewees’ play mentality too casual? Are our efforts better spent interviewing top-tier players? Is there really a connection between skill and willingness to improve? Next, we will begin to look at methods to gain more general knowledge of the tennis community in order to help us generate better-informed questions for our next round of interviews.
