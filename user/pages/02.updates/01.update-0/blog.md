> “You know what? Tennis is a pretty complicated sport. How do we pinpoint match trends, so that players can understand where and why they are losing points? 

> – Daniele (“the tennis guy”)

===

It was a long summer day on the court. Daniele, our resident tennis expert of over ten years, was practicing his strokes. His latest testing of the many available tennis apps frustrated him yet again. Whether it was lacking in proper user tutorials, had poorly designed interactions, or was flat-out unpleasant to use, tennis apps today simply were no good. Daniele wasn’t alone. Of the people he knew in his competitive tennis community, hardly any thought that technology could help them track and improve their performance.

Daniele wanted this to change. 

As a user experience developer with a penchant for tailoring products to people, he set out to create a well-researched assistive-coaching experience. He recruited his friends and fellow cat lovers: Ashley, Mandy and Jarielle. The four of us formed a complete team, the Meow Squad, where each member held a complementary skill-set to the others.
 
We had to resist jumping to the drawing board straight away. After all, the important question is: Does this problem really exist in the first place? What else besides our own anecdotal evidence supports this? Do we have enough information about the tennis and its players to clearly define the problem? This is where our generative research begins.
